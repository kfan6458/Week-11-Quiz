                Luckily, game designers feel your pain and for years they have provided us with an outlet to play God
                and construct our very own utopias. Why brave the real streets when you can just build your own to go
                anywhere your heart desires? We've constructed our very own list of the Best City Building Games of All
                Time so that you can find the ideal way to create a world of your very own.

                Updated March 17, 2023 by Ryan Bamsey: City builders are some of the most gratifying games out there -
                the ability to construct sprawling metropolises from the most humble beginnings evokes a wonderful
                feeling of accomplishment. We've gone over this list to add more of our favorites, including a unique,
                calming virtual reality experience.

                One of the most satisfying things about city builders is that they allow you to create sprawling
                settlements that you'd love to live in. Little Cities takes that compelling gameplay and takes you right
                into the city you build thanks to the wonders of virtual reality, allowing you to see close-up the inner
                workings of your metropolis. It has all the usual trappings of a city builder - laying roads, deciding
                which buildings go where, etcetera, but brings it to a whole new level of immersion.

                With the Little Citizens update, this immersion is increased tenfold, as you'll actually get to interact
                with the people who live in your city. You can wave at them and watch them as they go about their daily
                lives, whether they're indulging in some exciting skiing or hot air ballooning, or simply taking a
                breather to eat their lunch. This makes the world feel far more alive and capitalizes on the strengths
                of virtual reality really well, and the delightful soundtrack accentuates the cosy, calming direction
                the game takes. It's a breath of fresh air in a genre that loves to throw challenging scenarios and
                resource balancing acts at you.

                Cities XL deserves a spot on this list alone for how ambitious it was back at the time it was released.
                On the surface, it appeared to be a simple city-building game but it had an online multiplayer component
                which was interesting, to say the least. Cities XL also allowed players to interact with one another in
                a persistent planet. Each city belongs to a player and each player can even trade with others, basically
                running a simulated world.

                Sadly this online service was closed several months later and Cities XL became just a single-player game
                instead of an MMO based around city-building. Even so, it was a big deal back in its time and was one of
                the best city-building games back then before SimCity and Cities: Skylines improved on the 3D
                city-builder formula.

                Going Medieval is a colony sim game that follows a small group of people who find themselves without a
                home thanks to the Black Death. You'll start out with a handful of raw material and eventually work your
                way towards building a whole settlement.

                While the game is still in Early Access, Going Medieval boasts a great deal of content, consistent
                updates, and the capability to pull of some really impressive building projects, if you have the time
                and patience to pursue such a thing.
